This consortium of labs brings expertise in visual cortical processing, visual plasticity and astrocyte biology and provides the opportunity to bridge measurements across scales and modalities.\\n\\nThe goal of the project is to reveal the contribution of astrocyte subtypes to visual plasticity. The overwhelming majority of work on cortical plasticity has focused on neurons. With their demonstrated roles in synaptic modeling, synaptic communication and neuromodulation, astrocytes could play a fundamental role in driving or modulating neural plasticity. To address this, we use a synergistic combination of approaches, including controlled visual deprivation experiments, single cell gene expression profiling, physiological and neuroanatomical measurements, in vivo and ex vivo, combined with chemogenetic manipulation of local astrocyte activity.\\n\\nThe selected fellow will investigate the role of astrocytes in plasticity by combining visual deprivation assays with characterization of dynamic neuron-glia interactions upon sensory plasticity. The work will involve ex vivo characterization, as well as cellular imaging of dendritic spines, calcium imaging of neurons and chemogenetic activation and inactivation of neurons and astrocytes in the awake behaving mouse. Targeting of specific cell subtypes will be guided by single cell transcriptome work and observations in fixed tissue and cortical brain slices, performed by our partner labs.\\n\\nThe fellow will closely collaborate with members of the Arckens and Holt labs on \\u2018omics, ex vivo physiology and neuroanatomical approaches. Fellows also have ample opportunities to interact with partner labs at VIB and KU Leuven. Career advancement activities, such as presentations at international scientific events, writing of funding proposals and organization of workshops, are strongly encouraged.\\n\\nProfile\\n\\nWe seek a highly motivated individual with strong quantitative and technical skills and a collaborative spirit. While we have a preference for postdoctoral candidates, highly motivated and accomplished Master\\u2019s students who desire to do an ambitious PhD project will also be considered.\\n\\nPhD student applicants: MSc degree in life sciences, physical sciences or engineering, with significant lab experience and a strong interest in quantitative anatomy or physiology are encouraged to apply. Prior experience in electrophysiology, in vivo imaging, quantitative animal behaviour or in data analysis is an advantage. Applications outside the NERF PhD program are welcome.\\n\\nPostdoc applicants: PhD (or expected PhD) in neurobiology or a relevant field with an excellent research track record, strong technical and data analytical abilities (Python, MATLAB), and demonstrated ability to independently run projects are encouraged to apply. Prior experience with mice or in vivo electrophysiology, imaging or opto- or chemogenetics is an advantage but not a requirement. Computational scientists with interest in experimental neuroscience are encouraged to apply.\\n\\nWe offer\\n\\nOpportunity to do cutting edge science in a supportive and collaborative team. The candidate will join the vibrant community of students and postdocs at NERF and Leuven Brain Institute. The lab has a strong multidisciplinary team with expertise in cortical and thalamocortical processing, large-scale and cellular resolution optical and electrical recordings, and is known for its open and collegial atmosphere and the strength of its collaborative work.\\n\\nState-of-the-art tools and facilities: The laboratory is equipped with dedicated surgical, behavioral, and viral vector facilities, multiple setups for multiphoton microscopy, widefield imaging, high-density electrode recordings (Neuropixels) and patterned-light optogenetics. Proximity to exciting research institutes at the heart of Europe. NERF is within walking distance of KU Leuven on the campus of Imec, a world-leader in nanoelectronics research.
